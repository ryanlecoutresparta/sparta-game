##My Sparta Game: Squares

##### Description: I have created a game where the user controls a square that they must move (using the arrow keys) to collect coins to progress through levels whilst avoiding the red squares. The user has 3 lives and 30 seconds per level - if either of these run out, it's game over.
**Creator: Ryan Lecoutre**

**Technology Used - Atom, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Google Chrome.**

## Challenges:

1. Creating smooth movement of the user-controlled square through allowing diagonal movement.

2. Adding collision detection between the user-controlled square and the red squares, and between the user and the coins.

3. Creating multiple levels that all function correctly, with the current lives remaining carrying over between them.

## Takeaways:

1. Improved my JavaScript knowledge greatly.

2. Improved at researching and creating solutions to problems that I faced.

3. Gained an understanding of the HTML5 canvas element.

## Code Blocks:

How I solved the collision detection:

```JavaScript
if (Game.player.x <= x + size && Game.player.y <= y + size && Game.player.y + 30 >= y && Game.player.x >= x){
  Game.player.x = 30;
  Game.player.y = 30;
  Game.livesRemaining--;
  if (Game.livesRemaining === 0) {
    window.location.href = '../html/gameOver.html';
  }
}
if (Game.player.x + 30 >= x && Game.player.y <= y + size && Game.player.y + 30 >= y && Game.player.x + 30 <= x + size){
  Game.player.x = 30;
  Game.player.y = 30;
  Game.livesRemaining--;
  if (Game.livesRemaining === 0) {
    window.location.href = '../html/gameOver.html';
  }
}
```

How I created diagonal and smooth movement (through allowing keys pressed to be logged into an array):

```JavaScript
document.addEventListener('keydown', (event) => {
  Game.keysPressed = (Game.keysPressed || []);
  Game.keysPressed[event.keyCode] = true;
});

document.addEventListener('keyup', (event) => {
  Game.keysPressed[event.keyCode] = false;
});
```
